Write a query to output the names of those students whose&nbsp;best friends got offered a higher salary than them. Names must be ordered by the salary amount offered to the best friends. It is guaranteed that no two students got same salary offer.

__Sample Input__

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/12895/1443820100-adb691b2f5-2_2.png" />

__Sample Output__

    Samantha
    Julia
    Scarlet

<br>
__Explanation__

See the following table:

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/12895/1443819966-c37c146d27-3.png" />

Now,

<ul>
	<li><em>Samantha&#39;s</em> best friend got offered a higher salary than her at 11.55</li>
	<li><em>Julia&#39;s</em> best friend got offered a higher salary than her at 12.12</li>
	<li><em>Scarlet&#39;s</em> best friend got offered a higher salary than her at 15.2</li>
    <li><em>Ashley&#39;s</em> best friend did NOT get offered a higher salary than her</li>
</ul>

The name output, when ordered by the salary offered to their friends, will be:

<ul>
	<li><em>Samantha</em></li>
	<li><em>Julia</em></li>
	<li><em>Scarlet</em></li>
</ul>
